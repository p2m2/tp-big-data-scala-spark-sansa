|  assessDereferenceableBackLinks   | This metric measures the extent to which a resource includes all triples from the dataset that have the resource's URI as the object. The ratio computed is the number of objects that are "back-links" (are part of the resource's URI) and the total number of objects                                                                        | 
| assessDereferenceableForwardLinks | This metric measures the extent to which a resource includes all triples from the dataset that have the resource's URI as the subject. The ratio computed is the number of subjects that are "forward-links" (are part of the resource's URI) and the total number of subjects.                                                                 |
|     assessDereferenceableUris     | This metric calculates the number of valid redirects of URI. It computes the ratio between the number of all valid redirects (subject + predicates + objects)a.k.a dereferencedURIS and the total number of URIs on the dataset.                                                                                                                | 
|  assessInterlinkingCompleteness   | This metric measures the interlinking completeness. Since any resource of a dataset can be interlinked with another resource of a foreign dataset this metric makes a statement about the ratio of interlinked resources to resources that could potentially be interlinked.                                                                    |
|    assessPropertyCompleteness     | This metric measures the property completeness by checking the missing object values for the given predicate and given class of subjects. A user specifies the RDF class and the RDF predicate, then it checks for each pair whether instances of the given RDF class contain the specified RDF predicate.                                      |
|assessSchemaCompleteness| This metric measures the ratio of the number of classes and relations of the gold standard existing in g, and the number of classes and relations in the gold standard.                                                                                                                                                                         |
|assessExtensionalConciseness| The extensional conciseness. This metric metric checks for redundant resources in the assessed dataset, and thus measures the number of unique instances found in the dataset. return  No. of unique subjects / Total No. of subjects                                                                                                           |

|assessHumanReadableLicense| Human -readable indication of a license. This metric checks whether a human-readable text, stating the of licensing model attributed to the resource, has been provided as part of the dataset. It looks for objects containing literal values and analyzes the text searching for key, licensing related terms.                                |
|assessMachineReadableLicense| Machine -readable indication of a license. This metric checks whether a machine-readable text, stating the of licensing model attributed to the resource, has been provided as part of the dataset. It looks for objects containing literal values and analyzes the text searching for key, licensing related terms.                            |
